## Application Context

Nowadays, with all the environmental problems we face, we must try to opt for sustainable mobility alternatives. The bicycle is a great ally because it doesn’t pollute, doesn’t need fuel and promotes a healthy lifestyle. However, it’s always necessary to have an initial investment and when it is bought it’s not always possible to have a bike with us all the time. What if we could change that? The goal of our solution is that everyone can enjoy the benefits of a bicycle without having to travel with their bikes or even to purchase one. It doesn't matter if you are looking for a bike to go to work, to explore a new city, take a road ride or even to go mountain biking, our solution gives you that choice! Our app allows you to do this in a very simple way, for that you just have to choose a bike suitable for your use, choose the duration and finally pay for the rental duration. Done!
